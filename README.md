# OpenCV Temporal Tracking Test Project 

Test code to experiment with various tracking algorithms, intended to be run on an NVIDIA Jetson TK1. Can also be used on Linux and Windows PCs.

**Note that we won't provide support for this code; it is not necessarily reflective of best practices nor is it guaranteed to be functional.**

## Setup: 
Ensure you have openCV. Set Environment variables:

`OPENCV2_VS2015_DIR` = "C:\opencv\install\x64\vc14" (sample path)  
`OPENCV2_VS2015_VER` = 2413 (corresponds to 2.4.13)   

###Command line commands: 
`setx -m OPENCV2_VS2015_DIR "C:\opencv\install\x64\vc14" `  
`setx -m OPENCV2_VS2015_VER 2413`
